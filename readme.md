This is my side project to help change the world. All my free work is to benefit the greater whole.
As this is refined I will GPL and publish this work. People are free to contribute or watch my project.

The purpose of this application is to restore my faith in the inherent goodness of humanity. My goal is to prove that it is easy to do something selfless no matter how little time or money you have.

All contributions are anonymous by nature because we dont to things expecting a return. I will however track your submissions using a UUID in the background so that you can look back on your own success.

**To-do:**

I need to find a new low-cost serverless framework RIP Parse.api.
You probably will not be able to build this without the [Parse Libraries](https://parseplatform.org/) and your own backend to support the data.
