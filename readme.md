This is my side project to help change the world. All my free work is to benefit the greater whole.
As this is refined I will GPL and publish this work. People are free to contribute or watch my project.

**To-do:**

I need to find a new low-cost serverless framework RIP Parse.api.
You probably will not be able to build this without the [Parse Libraries](https://parseplatform.org/) and your own backend to support the data.
