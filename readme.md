**Author:** Michael A DeFrancesco

This is my side project to help change the world. All my free work is to benefit the greater whole.
As this is refined I will GPL and publish this work. People are free to contribute or watch my project.

The purpose of this application is to restore my faith in the inherent goodness of humanity. My goal is to prove that it is easy to do something selfless no matter how little time or money you have.

All contributions are anonymous by nature because we dont do things expecting a return. I will however track your submissions using a UUID in the background so that you can look back on your own success.

### What is it?

Butterfly effect is effectively a Twitter clone, a post consists of a 140 character blurb of what you have done, it also includes how much time and money you spent.

### Self Sufficiency

* In order to pay for the infrastructure I plan to charge a small fee <1$ in order to make a post public. My plan is that as more people contribute and compete for more influential good deeds that more people will want credit for what they have done.

* Should I raise more money than needed for hosting on any given month I would like to pipe the extra money to select nonprophits so that the project itself can be more influencial of a change in the world.

**To-do:**

* I need to find a new low-cost serverless framework RIP Parse.api.
~~You probably will not be able to build this without the [Parse Libraries](https://parseplatform.org/) and your own backend to support the data.~~
* Now using Google Firebase
